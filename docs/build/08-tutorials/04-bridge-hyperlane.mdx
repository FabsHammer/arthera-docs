title: Hyperlane Quickstart
---

👋 This guide will help you deploy your Hyperlane bridge to Arthera chain as quickly as possible. This includes the core mailbox and ISM contracts as well as warp route contracts for assets you’re bridging

The guide is intended for testing - by the end you’ll be able to pass messages between Arthera chain and any other in the Hyperlane network.

To go to production, ensure you’ve successfully pushed a registry PR (the last step) and reach back over telegram and we can add Arthera chain to the core chains we have in the CLI and relay for.

## Pre-Requisites: Chain Metadata & Funded Wallet

Anyone can begin this quickstart guide once they have the following artifacts & assets available:

- A new, custom, or pre-existing network of your choice, including the following metadata:
    - A chain name, e.g. `arthera`
    - A chain ID, e.g. `10242`
    - A RPC URL, e.g. `https://rpc.arthera.net`
- A deployer wallet/EOA private key or seed phrase
    - This EOA should be funded on Arthera chain and any chain you will be passing messages to & from
- The Hyperlane CLI npm package installed (see below)

## 1) Install the Hyperlane CLI

To install the Hyperlane CLI npm package globally, run:

```bash
pnpm i -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli
```

Verify the expected version is installed via:

```bash
hyperlane --version
```

To view a list of all available command, run:

```bash
hyperlane --help
```

## 2) Registry: Add Arthera chain

Let’s create a custom chain config, run:

```bash
hyperlane registry init
```

Follow the prompts to set up your RPC URL, chain name, and chain ID. Setting up block or gas properties is optional. Once successful, you should see this output:

```tsx
Skipping updating chain arthera at github registry
Now updating chain arthera at filesystem registry at $HOME/.hyperlane
Done updating chain arthera at filesystem registry
```

Now, under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains` you will find a new folder named with Arthera chain’s name, and a file named `metadata.yaml` within that folder.

- Example content of this config at `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/arthera/metadata.yaml` :
    
    ```yaml
    # yaml-language-server: $schema=../schema.json
    name: arthera
    chainId: 10242
    domainId: 10242
    protocol: ethereum
    rpcUrls:
      - http: https://rpc.arthera.net
    nativeToken:
      name: Arthera
      symbol: AA
      decimals: 18
    ```
    

## 3) Core: define & deploy Arthera chain’s core contracts

Next, let’s configure, deploy and test Arthera chain’s core contracts.

### Configure: `hyperlane core configure`

1. From your local environment, source the private key or seed phrase of your funded deployer address via `HYP_KEY.`For example: `export HYP_KEY='<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>'`
2. Verify your `HYP_KEY` is sourced correctly via `echo $HYP_KEY`
3. From the same instance, run:
    
    ```bash
    hyperlane core init
    ```
    
- After successfully creating a new core deployment config, you can find it in a file named `core-config.yaml` within  `./configs`  - here is an example config
    
    ```yaml
    owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
    defaultIsm:
      type: trustedRelayerIsm
      relayer: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
    defaultHook:
      type: merkleTreeHook
    requiredHook:
      owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
      type: protocolFee
      beneficiary: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
      maxProtocolFee: "100000000000000000"
      protocolFee: "0"
    ```
    

### Deploy: `hyperlane core deploy`

Continuing in the same instance with your HYP_KEY sourced, run:

```bash
hyperlane core deploy
```

Use the arrows and enter to select Arthera chain from the bottom of the mainnet list. 
It will take about five minutes for all contracts to deploy.

- Under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains` you will find a new folder named with Arthera chain’s name, and a file named `addresses.yaml` within that folder - example:
    
    ```yaml
    staticMerkleRootMultisigIsmFactory: "0x6906cb4741d3E2322E9f9aA645DfC8AB6F122c47"
    staticMessageIdMultisigIsmFactory: "0x3CE97a32d9C8294691cBd2baC09B078EDa75c429"
    staticAggregationIsmFactory: "0x81f969fDBF48278Ce09685Ce48e03388B6785aF4"
    staticAggregationHookFactory: "0x3d864A3c25F61E3c3A7d02e980453A6E1f0a92A6"
    domainRoutingIsmFactory: "0xC4c01f7B03f0fFa77A0265C600dEF7Ad28BCa5A2"
    proxyAdmin: "0xABb7175d5F123172E7B7Fa467CC9fE4C2FEdb942"
    mailbox: "0x5F58d75A9caDE4e2b191313223978dF049f93b81"
    interchainAccountRouter: "0x43c0745b0dE9Cb780816a24ddE63d79Ca99B5dE8"
    interchainAccountIsm: "0x9C96dC8f4257413225d6B5C47d1afbafc39B269F"
    validatorAnnounce: "0xE3bd39BF92DB385dE6313D6070b035bD934378CB"
    testRecipient: "0xa58462b1943Be1469Ed58db690C78583BA34Fd2E"
    ```
    

### Send Core Test Message: `hyperlane send message`

In the same instance, run:

```bash
hyperlane send message --relay
```

Currently core self-relay only works from **an existing origin chain** (e.g. holesky) **to Arthera chain**. When dispatch is successful, you should see that the message was self-relayed!


🎉 **Congrats! You have successfully sent a message to Arthera chain**



## 4) Warp Route: configure & deploy Arthera chain’s warp route contracts

Now that you have a Hyperlane mailbox and core contracts on your chain, it’s time to set up ERC-20 token bridging between your chain and any other Hyperlane chain.

### Configure: `hyperlane warp configure`

1. In the same funded instance, run:
    
    ```bash
    hyperlane warp init
    ```
    
2. Select the chains you want to set up a warp route between, e.g.  `arthera, holesky`
3. Select the token type you want to support for each
    1. Select `native` if you want to use the native gas token of that chain, e.g. ETH
    2. Select `synthetic` 
        1. `synthetic` warp routes allows you to lock the token as collateral on one chain and mint a synthetic on another.
        2. You can also select `collateralVault` to use an ERC-4626 vault as collateral - this enables you to create yield-bearing bridged tokens.
    - If successful, under `./configs` you will see the following valid warp route config in file named `warp-route-deployment.yaml`
        
        ```yaml
        arthera:
          isNft: false
          type: native
          owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
          mailbox: "0x5F58d75A9caDE4e2b191313223978dF049f93b81"
          interchainSecurityModule:
            type: staticAggregationIsm
            modules:
              - type: trustedRelayerIsm
                relayer: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
              - owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
                type: defaultFallbackRoutingIsm
                domains: {}
            threshold: 1
        holesky:
          isNft: false
          type: native
          owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
          mailbox: "0x5b6CFf85442B851A8e6eaBd2A4E4507B5135B3B0"
          interchainSecurityModule:
            type: staticAggregationIsm
            modules:
              - type: trustedRelayerIsm
                relayer: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
              - owner: "0x16F4898F47c085C41d7Cc6b1dc72B91EA617dcBb"
                type: defaultFallbackRoutingIsm
                domains: {}
            threshold: 1
        ```
        

### Deploy: `hyperlane warp deploy`

Continuing, run and confirm the deployment:

```bash
hyperlane warp deploy
```

- Example output for your warp route config
    
    Under `$HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/` you will find a new folder named with Arthera or other chain’s native token name, and two files named `holesky-arthera-addresses.yaml` & `holesky-arthera-config.yaml` within that folder
    
    1. Example contents of this config at `$HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/AVAX/holesky-arthera-addresses.yaml` based on the above examples:
        
        ```yaml
        arthera:
          native: "0x205A5d97111abe0C53C0459cF37013F16Ff67889"
        holesky:
          synthetic: "0x3924C4E264085f2f832bE5a65A42995A726BdFBf"
        ```
        
    2. Example contents of this config at `$HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/AVAX/holesky-arthera-config.yaml` based on the above examples:
        
        ```yaml

        ```

💸 **Well done, a Hyperlane warp route is now deployed to Arthera chain.**

### Send Warp Test Message: `hyperlane warp send`

Run a command that includes your warp route config:

```bash
hyperlane warp send --relay --warp $HOME/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/TOKEN/corechain-arthera-config.yaml
```

You can test in either direction between where you have the warp route set. However, if you deployed `native` and `synthetic` warp routes, you must select the origin with the `native` route deployed.

## 5) Submit to Registry: ensure Arthera configs & deployments are available in the registry

If you want other chains to connect with you as well as to take this to production with Abacus Works, make a registry PR.

1. Navigate to your local instance of the registry and commit changes

```bash
cd ~/.hyperlane && git init && git add . && git commit
```

1. Sync local registry with canonical registry

```bash
git remote add canonical git@github.com:hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry.git
git pull canonical main --rebase
```

1. Push local registry to github fork and submit a PR

🏅 **Congrats! You have successfully deployed Hyperlane to Arthera chain and added your work to the Hyperlane registry.**

**Thank you for contributing to the future of permissionless interop** 🫡
